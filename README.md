bindercrypt
===========

Bind 2 exe's and have them run at the same time.

The script can be encrypted with the -e switch, but if either of your exe's are detected by AV they still will be, because the script just writes out the exe's to a system variable eg. TEMP, then runs them both at the same time.  

This only works on windows. dropper.py can be compiled into an exe with pyinstaller.

		usage: ./bindercrypt.py [options]
		
		optional arguments:
		  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
		  -m MEXE, --mexe MEXE  Malicious exe/bat/vbs to drop, hide and run.
		  -i IEXE, --iexe IEXE  Inert exe/bat/vbs to drop and run.
		  -u URL, --url URL     URL to download and run binary from.
		  -v VAR, --var VAR     System variable to place the files, eg TEMP
		  -e, --encrypt         Encrypt the dropper to evade AV.
